## Project/Story Description
Traditionally, people have produced visualizations in order to make sense of data,
but we feel that we are reaching the limits of this approach. Open data efforts have
led to the release diverse, rich and varied open datasets. Human vision simply does
not have enough bandwidth to consume such complex data, so we experimented with the
use of other senses to experience data.

At the Bicoastal Datafest, we produced the FMS Symphony, a music video about the
relationships between federal spending, the federal interest rate, the debt ceiling
and the financial crisis over the past few years.

    * visuals cannot fully capture the dimensionality of big data

    * we need new sensory experiences to express more dimensions
    * obama video - what do kids like? dubsteb and big data
    * we need poppy big data music videos
