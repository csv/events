## What Challenge Did You Address?
OTHER - Define Below

## If the challenge you addressed is not on the list above, please describe it here.
Governments have recently made great strides towards opening raw datasets online,
but much still needs to be done to make them accessible and comprehensible.

## Project/Story Description
Traditionally, people have produced visualizations in order to make sense of data,
but we feel that we are reaching the limits of this approach. Open data efforts have
led to the release diverse, rich and varied open datasets. Human vision simply does
not have enough bandwidth to consume such complex data, so we experimented with the
use of other senses to experience data.

At the Bicoastal Datafest, we produced the FMS Symphony, a music video about the
relationships between federal spending, the federal interest rate, the debt ceiling
and the financial crisis over the past few years.

We've continued to explore the potential of non-visual senses, and we think that
music videos are just the beginning. Music videos convey only two senses. In order
to increase our data bandwidth, we need to use all five senses, and we think that
that is best accomplished through food.

For the National Day of Civic Hacking, we made an R library called "gastronomify"
that allows data to be converted into food. It modifies a base recipe based on the
data passed to it, and then it automatically hires someone to prepare the recipe
with TaskRabbit.

## How Will This Project Have Impact?
Gastronomification facilitates an ambient, passive approache data analysis, allowing
people to experience richer datasets without specialized knowledge.

## What Happens Next?
We are continuing our research into data gastronomification, and we are preparing
more music videos for a CSV Soundsystem US tour.

Our current data gastronomification implementation is quite naive; we are working
with a chef to explore different paradigms of expressing data in food. We aim for
an approach that allows us to independently vary the texture, taste, visual
appearance and smell of food, allowing us to employ all five senses for conveying data.

We have been lining up performance venues and preparing a full set of music videos.
We recently produced the Ridership Rachenitsa, a music video about transit ridership
over the past few years in Chicago and New York. We are currently working on the
BitCoin <?>, a music video about the BitCoin economy, and the New York <?>, a music
video about the daily activities of New Yorkers.

## Who Does This Project or Story Affect?
???

## How Might This Project or Story Create Value for Individuals?
Data gastronomification and data music videos are part of the larger theme of
conveying complex quantitative information to the general public in order to engage
them in important issues. In order to make the best use of open data, we need to
make it comprehensible to everyone.

## How Does This Project or Story Show the Value of Collaboration Between Communities and/or Corporations, and/or Governments?
